First is to create a repository where the code will be stored, next is to add the necessary files needed for the project by using git clone + personal like. Enable Github pages by customizing the visibility and the branches to generate the live website link. Lastly, if you have any changes to your github page you can do so by committing and pushing the changes you made.

My key takeaways from this exercise is that it is important to learn how to utilize both HTML and CSS to your advantage most especially in creating websites. This exercise helped me in recalling the syntax as well as how each of their attributes and properties contribute to create meaningful and professional-looking websites.
